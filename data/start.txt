	`It's been two years since your ship got stranded here. After you piloted the Kalash into orbit around this gas giant, you haven't touched a set a ship's controls. That changes today.`
	`	You approach the door to the refitted drone hanger where your new ship has been worked on for the past six months. Now that it's done you're feeling a little nervous.`
	`	You scan your badge on the keypad as it chimes, "To verify your identity, please state your name."`
