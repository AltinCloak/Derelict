	description "Rather than being a specific model of ship, the Scrappers are instead a family of vessels cobbled together from the remains of broken shuttles. On the rare occasion that Republic authorities bother to recognize their existence, Scrappers are treated as almost-illegal, patent-infringing death traps. Despite this, these ships are where many captains (and pirates) from poorer backgrounds get their start."
