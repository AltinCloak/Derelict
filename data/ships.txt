	description "Combat drones are pilotless attack ships used primarily by the Republic Navy. Although very weak and easy to destroy, they can be very effective in large numbers. Because drones do not need a cockpit, they can be filled entirely with equipment and solid metal, which makes their hulls stronger than other small ships."

	description "Rather than being a specific model of ship, the Scrappers are instead a family of vessels cobbled together from the remains of broken shuttles. On the rare occasion that Republic authorities bother to recognize their existence, Scrappers are treated as almost-illegal, patent-infringing death traps. Despite this, these ships are where many captains (and pirates) from poorer backgrounds get their start."
